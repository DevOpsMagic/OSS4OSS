| https://opensourceindex.io/         | Open Source Contributor Index | Commercial organizations are ranked by the volume of their employees’ year-to-date open source contributions on GitHub
| https://chaoss.community/           | Community Health Analytics    | CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating metrics, metrics models, and software to better understand open source community health on a global scale.
| Security                            |                               |               |
| https://github.com/awesomeSBOM/awesome-sbom/ | Awesome list of SBOM tools | A curated list of SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) related tools, frameworks, blogs, podcasts, and articles 
| https://opensourcesecurityindex.io/ | Open Source Security Index    | The Most Popular & Fastest Growing Open Source Security Projects on GitHub
| https://in-toto.io/                 | A framework to secure the integrity of software supply chains | in-toto is designed to ensure the integrity of a software product from initiation to end-user installation. It does so by making it transparent to the user what steps were performed, by whom and in what order. 
| https://deps.dev/                   | Understand your dependencies  | Examines each package, constructs a full, detailed graph of its dependencies and their properties.The service currently indexes the Cargo, Go, Maven, npm, NuGet and PyPI package ecosystems, the GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket project hosts, and the security advisories from OSV. 
| https://www.softwaretransparency.org/osskb | Snippet-level software identification against a public knowledgebase | Detect declared and undeclared open source software in your software composition, you can check against plagiarism of any open source introduced by copy/paste     
| https://ossinsight.io/ | GitHub Data Explorer | Gain deep insight into developers and repos on GitHub about stars, pull requests, issues, pushes, comments, reviews. Provides comprehensive, valuable, and trending insights into the open source world by analyzing 5+ billion rows of GitHub events data.
| https://oss-review-toolkit.org/ort/ | A suite of CLI tools to automate software compliance checks | Get the dependencies of your projects, supporting over a dozen different package managers. Download the source code of your dependencies from version control systems or source artifacts. Get the vulnerabilities of your dependencies from different providers.
| https://scorecard.dev/ | Assess OSS projects for risky practices | Scorecard assesses open source projects for security risks through a series of automated checks.
| https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score | Create a list of critical projects that the open source community depends on. | A project's criticality score defines the influence and importance of a project. It is a number between 0 (least-critical) and 1 (most-critical).
| https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria | Achieve Best Practices badges at the passing, silver, and gold badge levels. | OSS users can quickly assess which projects are following best practices and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
| https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/insights/ | Holistic view of your ecosystem | Make data-driven decisions with a contextualized view of your entire contributor ecosystem.
| https://github.com/ossf/allstar | OpenSSF Scorecard project to automate security policy enforcement | Allstar is a GitHub App that continuously monitors GitHub organizations or repositories for adherence to security best practices. If Allstar detects a security policy violation, it creates an issue to alert the repository or organization owner.
| https://slsa.dev/ | Set of guidelines to secure the software supply chain (currently limited to the build process) | SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable guidelines for enhancing supply chain security. SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers use SLSA’s guidelines to secure their software, and consumers use SLSA to determine whether to trust the software.
| https://www.sigstore.dev/ | Reduce the effort to sign and verify the integrity and provenance of artifacts | Automates how you digitally sign and check components, for a safer chain of custody tracing software back to the source
| https://osv.dev/ | A distributed vulnerability database for Open Source | An open, precise, and distributed approach to producing and consuming vulnerability information for open source.
| https://guac.sh/ | Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition | (GUAC) and visualizing the supply chain gives you organized and actionable insights into your software supply chain security position. GUAC ingests software security metadata, like SBOMs, and maps out the relationship between software so that you can fully understand your software security position.
| https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz | fuzzing tool | OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by using modern fuzzing techniques
