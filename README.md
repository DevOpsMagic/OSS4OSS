| **Incentivizing security best practices**  |                               |               |
| https://scorecard.dev/ | Assess OSS projects for risky practices | Scorecard assesses open source projects for security risks through a series of automated checks.
| https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria | Achieve Best Practices badges at the passing, silver, and gold badge levels. | OSS users can quickly assess which projects are following best practices and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
| https://github.com/ossf/allstar | OpenSSF Scorecard project to automate security policy enforcement | Allstar is a GitHub App that continuously monitors GitHub organizations or repositories for adherence to security best practices. If Allstar detects a security policy violation, it creates an issue to alert the repository or organization owner.
| https://slsa.dev/ | Set of guidelines to secure the software supply chain (currently limited to the build process) | SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable guidelines for enhancing supply chain security. SLSA is useful for both software producers and consumers: producers use SLSA’s guidelines to secure their software, and consumers use SLSA to determine whether to trust the software.
| https://oss-review-toolkit.org/ort/ | A suite of CLI tools to automate software compliance checks | Get the dependencies of your projects, supporting over a dozen different package managers. Download the source code of your dependencies from version control systems or source artifacts. Get the vulnerabilities of your dependencies from different providers.
| https://github.com/fossology/fossology | Open source license compliance software system and toolkit | As a toolkit, you can run license, copyright, and export control scans from the command line. As a system, a database and web UI are provided to give you a compliance workflow. In one click you can generate an SPDX file.
| **Dependency Analysis**                 |                               |               |
| https://github.com/safedep/vet | Policy as Code for Open Source Software Supply Chain | vet is a tool for identifying risks in open source software supply chain. It provides visibility on OSS package risks due to it's license, popularity, security hygiene, etc. vet is designed with the goal of helping software development teams consume safe and trusted OSS components through automated vetting in CI/CD. 
| https://deps.dev/                   | Understand your dependencies  | Examines each package, constructs a full, detailed graph of its dependencies and their properties.The service currently indexes the Cargo, Go, Maven, npm, NuGet and PyPI package ecosystems, the GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket project hosts, and the security advisories from OSV. 
| **Signing and Verification**                            |                               |               |
| https://in-toto.io/                 | A framework to secure the integrity of software supply chains | in-toto is designed to ensure the integrity of a software product from initiation to end-user installation. It does so by making it transparent to the user what steps were performed, by whom and in what order. 
| https://www.sigstore.dev/ | Reduce the effort to sign and verify the integrity and provenance of artifacts | Automates how you digitally sign and check components, for a safer chain of custody tracing software back to the source
| **Data Explorers**                            |                               |               |
| https://opensourcesecurityindex.io/ | Open Source Security Index    | The Most Popular & Fastest Growing Open Source Security Projects on GitHub
| https://www.softwaretransparency.org/osskb | Snippet-level software identification against a public knowledgebase | Detect declared and undeclared open source software in your software composition, you can check against plagiarism of any open source introduced by copy/paste     
| https://ossinsight.io/ | GitHub Data Explorer | Gain deep insight into developers and repos on GitHub about stars, pull requests, issues, pushes, comments, reviews. Provides comprehensive, valuable, and trending insights into the open source world by analyzing 5+ billion rows of GitHub events data.
| https://osv.dev/ | A distributed vulnerability database for Open Source | An open, precise, and distributed approach to producing and consuming vulnerability information for open source.
| https://guac.sh/ | Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition | (GUAC) and visualizing the supply chain gives you organized and actionable insights into your software supply chain security position. GUAC ingests software security metadata, like SBOMs, and maps out the relationship between software so that you can fully understand your software security position.
| **Specialized Security Testing** | |  
| https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz | fuzzing tool | OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by using modern fuzzing techniques
